What is it?
===========

Request.el is a HTTP request library with multiple backends.  It
supports url.el which is shipped with Emacs and curl command line
program.  User can use curl when s/he has it, as curl is more reliable
than url.el.  Library author can use request.el to avoid imposing
external dependencies such as curl to users while giving richer
experience for users who have curl.

As request.el is implemented in extensible manner, it is possible to
implement other backend such as wget.  Also, if future version of
Emacs support linking with libcurl, it is possible to implement a
backend using it.  Libraries using request.el automatically can
use these backend without modifying their code.

Request.el also patches url.el dynamically, to fix bugs in url.el.
See `monkey patches for url.el`_ for the bugs fixed by request.el.


Examples
========

GET::

  (request
   "http://httpbin.org/get"
   :params '(("key" . "value") ("key2" . "value2"))
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "I sent: %S" (assoc-default 'args data)))))

POST::

  (request
   "http://httpbin.org/post"
   :type "POST"
   :data '(("key" . "value") ("key2" . "value2"))
   ;; :data "key=value&key2=value2"  ; this is equivalent
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "I sent: %S" (assoc-default 'form data)))))

POST file (**WARNING**: it will send the contents of the current buffer!)::

  (request
   "http://httpbin.org/post"
   :type "POST"
   :files `(("current buffer" . ,(current-buffer))
            ("data" . ("data.csv" :data "1,2,3\n4,5,6\n")))
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "I sent: %S" (assoc-default 'files data)))))

Rich callback dispatch (like `jQuery.ajax`)::

  (request
   "http://httpbin.org/status/418"     ; try other codes, for example:
   ;; "http://httpbin.org/status/200"  ; success callback will be called.
   ;; "http://httpbin.org/status/400"  ; you will see "Got 400."
   :parser 'buffer-string
   :success
   (cl-function (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
                  (when data
                    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*request demo*")
                      (erase-buffer)
                      (insert data)
                      (pop-to-buffer (current-buffer))))))
   :error
   (cl-function (lambda (&rest args &key error-thrown &allow-other-keys)
                  (message "Got error: %S" error-thrown)))
   :complete (lambda (&rest _) (message "Finished!"))
   :status-code '((400 . (lambda (&rest _) (message "Got 400.")))
                  (418 . (lambda (&rest _) (message "Got 418.")))))

Flexible PARSER option::

  (request
   "https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request/commits/master.atom"
   ;; Parse XML in response body:
   :parser (lambda () (libxml-parse-xml-region (point) (point-max)))
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               ;; Just don't look at this function....
               (let ((get (lambda (node &rest names)
                            (if names
                                (apply get
                                       (first (xml-get-children
                                               node (car names)))
                                       (cdr names))
                              (first (xml-node-children node))))))
                 (message "Latest commit: %s (by %s)"
                          (funcall get data 'entry 'title)
                          (funcall get data 'entry 'author 'name))))))

PUT JSON data::

  (request
   "http://httpbin.org/put"
   :type "PUT"
   :data (json-encode '(("key" . "value") ("key2" . "value2")))
   :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "I sent: %S" (assoc-default 'json data)))))

Another PUT JSON example (nested JSON using alist structure, how to represent a boolean & how to selectively evaluate lisp)::

  (request
   "http://httpbin.org/put"
   :type "PUT"
    :data (json-encode `(("jsonArray" . (        ; Prepend alist structure with a backtick (`) rather than single quote (') to allow elisp evaluation of selected elements prefixed with a comma (,)
                       ("item1" . "value 1")
                       ("item2" . t) ; This value is expected as a boolean so use the nil / t elisp alist denotation
                       ("item3" . ,(your-custom-elisp-function)) ; The function will be evaluated as it has been prefixed with a comma (,)
                       )
               )))
   :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "I sent: %S" (assoc-default 'json data)))))

GET with Unix domain socket data::

  (request
   "http:/hello.txt"
   :unix-socket "/tmp/app.sock"
   :parser (lambda () (buffer-string))
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "Got: %s" data))))
